# Bandcamp Volume

A Firefox extension that adds a volume slider to [Bandcamp](http://www.bandcamp.com) album pages. Based on [Bandcamp Volume for Chrome](https://github.com/ubercow/bandcamp_volume) by Zak Kristjanson.


## Usage
You can download and install this extension from the official Mozilla add-ons repository: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bandcamp-volume/

## Background
Bandcamp is a great music site with a lot for albums. It uses an html5 based audio player. This player, however, lacks any form of volume control. When asked about it, Bandcamp responded with the following:

From the [Bandcamp FAQ Page](http://bandcamp.com/faq#volume):
> There isn't one. If your fans want to change the volume of the audio on Bandcamp, they adjust their computer's volume -- simple as that. We're not trying to build the ultimate platform for them to stream your albums while they play World of Warcraft in another window (which we completely agree would require an independent volume control). The streams on Bandcamp are there so visitors can listen to your music, decide if they like it, and if so, download it. Nothing more.

## Known Limitations
Works for album/track pages. Also works at the front page. Does not work in collections.
